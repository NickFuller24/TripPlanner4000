# TripPlanner4000

This was a project for a Senior Design class. We created a trip planning app that combined weather and maps to let users know what the weather looked like along their route. The three APIs used to accomplish this were:
1. Mapbox
2. TomTom
3. OpenWeatherMaps

Here is a demo video showing what we accomplished: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tu2jgKeeQ8&ab_channel=NickFuller
